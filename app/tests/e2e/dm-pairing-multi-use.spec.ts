/**
 * E2E: pairing — multi-use within the active window (AC-PAIR-4; also
 * reprises AC-ADMIT-6's admission outcome for a second, independent
 * scanner).
 *
 * Epic: contact-pairing-code, story S6. Proves the issuer's active nonce is
 * NOT consumed by its first use: A shares ONE code, TWO different scanners
 * (B, then C) each independently scan the SAME still-live code, and A
 * auto-admits BOTH — no re-share, no second code, and B's earlier use has no
 * effect on C's outcome. Every action is driven through the real app:
 *   - A's code comes from the real Profile "Share contact card" action
 *     (getShareCardLink), exactly once.
 *   - B's and C's scans are each a real `/add#c=…` navigation against that
 *     SAME payload — the real deep-link entry point, not a re-derived or
 *     re-fetched code.
 *   - The functional-admission proof (not just a knownPeers entry) is a real
 *     chat-input send from A to C, observed as a `msg-*` bubble on C's page.
 *
 * Both scans happen well within the nonce's 30-minute active window (no
 * expiry simulation needed here — that is dm-pairing-expired-grace.spec.ts's
 * concern).
 *
 * SUPERSESSION (2026-07-15, spec.md `## Amendments` — epic:
 * pending-contact-confirmation): that epic deliberately supersedes this
 * spec's "A auto-admits both [immediately]" framing for A's own DM-sending
 * side. A contact card is a bearer credential — anyone who obtains a leaked
 * card can pair with the issuer, and under the old auto-admit behavior that
 * pairing succeeded silently and permanently, so a leak was undetectable.
 * Requiring the card ISSUER (A) to explicitly confirm each incoming pairing
 * converts an invisible, irreversible admission into a visible, declinable
 * prompt — so A now holds both B and C as PENDING contacts after their
 * respective pairing-acks, and must confirm each before its chat opens. A
 * pending contact has no openable detail page, so step 5 below (the DM sanity
 * check from A to C) drives that confirm as an INLINE action on the contacts-
 * list row (`contact-pending-confirm-<hex>`) before A can send. This spec's
 * actual point — the nonce is
 * multi-use and BOTH B and C get admitted from the SAME code, with no
 * re-share and no second code — is UNCHANGED and still fully proven by
 * `waitForAdmission` succeeding for both in step 4 (which reads
 * `knownPeers`, unaffected by pending-confirmation); only the DM-sending
 * sanity check needed the confirm step inserted ahead of it.
 *
 * Requires the strfry relay harness: make e2e-up (or make test-e2e-groups).
 * Run: E2E_GROUPS=1 node scripts/run-e2e.mjs tests/e2e/dm-pairing-multi-use.spec.ts
