/**
 * processContactInput.ts — the single pure core for turning arbitrary
 * add-contact input (a bare npub, a signed contact-card link, or a raw card
 * payload) into a persisted contact.
 *
 * Extracted from the former `AddContactModal.tsx` so the `/add` deep-link
 * page (via `addDeepLink.ts`) can drive the exact same flow without depending
 * on any React component. The manual "Add Contact by npub" modal was removed
 * (the npub abstraction confused new users). A new trust relationship now
 * begins only two ways: sharing an MLS group, or opening a contact-card link
 * (`/add#c=…`, this module's path) — both seed `knownPeers`. An inbound DM is
 * NOT an admission path: the walled garden (`isAllowedDmSender`) drops any DM
 * from a sender not already allowed by one of those two, so a stranger can
 * never reach the user or become a contact. This module is the card-link
 * path's core.
 *
 * Routes `input` through `parseContactCard` — the single card decode seam
 * (contact-card-exchange architecture.md DD 1) — FIRST. A `{ error }` result
 * (e.g. a card whose signature does not verify) is treated as an add-failure
 * and `addContactByNpub` is never called: no silent downgrade to a
 * bare-pubkey add (AC-PARSE-4 / VQ-S4-006).
 *
 * On a successful parse, re-encodes the decoded `pubkeyHex` back to an npub
 * and calls the UNCHANGED `addContactByNpub(npub, ownPubkeyHex)` — contact /
 * knownPeers seeding behaves exactly as it did for a bare npub (AC-UX-1,
 * AC-UX-5).
 *
 * The card's profile cache write is independent of the add outcome (AC-UX-6):
 * `importCard` runs whenever the parsed result carries a `profile` AND the add
 * either succeeded or failed with `already_exists` — refreshing the cached
 * nickname (subject to `importCard`'s own LWW) even when no new contact entry
 * is created. A `self` rejection (or a parse failure) never calls `importCard`.
 *
 * Epic: contact-pairing-code, story S4. When the parsed card carries a
 * `pairing` field (S1's `ParsedPairingCard` seam — present iff the scanned
 * card is v2) AND the add either succeeded OR failed with `already_exists`
 * (the SAME `shouldImportProfile` gate AC-UX-6's cache refresh already uses
 * — review-remediation: a RETURNING scanner, one who already has the issuer
 * as a one-directional contact from before this epic, re-scanning the
 * issuer's live code must still reciprocate; the mutual channel this
 * feature exists to create must not silently fail to complete just because
 * the add itself was a no-op), this module computes a pure `pairingEcho`
 * candidate on the result: `{ issuerPubkeyHex, nonceHex, expiresAt }`,
 * gated only on the card's `expiresAt` not yet having passed per THIS
 * call's clock (AC-SCAN-2 — an already-expired v2 code degrades to the
 * plain one-directional add, no candidate, on EITHER branch). A malformed
 * pairing sub-object (defense-in-depth against untrusted input,
 * VQ-S4-006) degrades the same way rather than throwing. A `self`
 * rejection or a parse failure never carries a candidate — echoing to
 * one's own pubkey is meaningless and a parse failure has no `parsed.pairing`
 * to read. This module NEVER sends the echo or touches
 * `pendingIntent.ts`/`pairingAck.ts` itself — computing the candidate is
 * the full extent of the "decision" this pure core owns; the named-vs-
 * nameless branch and the actual network side effect belong to the caller
 * (`app/pages/add.tsx`), consistent with architecture.md's "S4 owns the
 * decision, S3 owns the mechanics" split.
 *
 * Epic: block-contact, story S4 (AC-VIEW-13). addContactByNpub's
 * already_exists result additionally carries blocked: true when the
 * matching stored contact is archived (blocked, DD-9) - re-adding by npub or
 * re-scanning a blocked peer's pairing card is a full cut-off in both
 * directions (DD-2). shouldImportProfile treats this as its own case,
 * distinct from an ordinary already_exists: neither importCard nor the
 * pairingEcho computation runs, so no cached-nickname refresh and no
 * reciprocation candidate are ever produced for a blocked peer, even when
 * their re-scanned card carries a live, unexpired v2 pairing field.
