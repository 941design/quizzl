/**
 * E2E: pairing — single-scan mutual admission (AC-ADMIT-6; also exercises
 * AC-PAIR-2/3, AC-SCAN-1/8, AC-ACK-1, AC-ADMIT-1/5).
 *
 * Epic: contact-pairing-code, story S6. This is the anchor scenario the
 * whole epic exists to prove: A shows ONE code, B opens it ONCE, and BOTH
 * directions of DM work afterward — the "no second scan" outcome AC-ADMIT-6
 * requires. Every action is driven through the real app:
 *   - A's code comes from the real Profile "Share contact card" action
 *     (getShareCardLink — drives the actual Share button, never hand-built).
 *   - B's scan is a real `/add#c=…` navigation (the app's own deep-link
 *     entry point), which — because B already has a name — immediately
 *     drives the app's own real `sendPairingAck` call (no test-side send).
 *   - Both DM directions are asserted by actually typing into `chat-input`
 *     and clicking `chat-send-btn`, then observing the peer's `msg-*`
 *     bubble render — never a lower-level proxy like `isAllowedDmSender`.
 *
 * A never scans B, never displays a second code, and never manually adds B —
 * the only admission path exercised is the pairing-ack's automatic one.
 *
 * SUPERSESSION (2026-07-15, spec.md `## Amendments` — epic:
 * pending-contact-confirmation): that epic deliberately supersedes this
 * spec's "both directions work *immediately*" promise. A contact card is a
 * bearer credential — anyone who obtains a leaked card can pair with the
 * issuer, and under the old auto-admit behavior that pairing succeeded
 * silently and permanently, so a leak was undetectable. Requiring the card
 * ISSUER (A, here) to explicitly confirm an incoming pairing converts an
 * invisible, irreversible admission into a visible, declinable prompt. So A
 * now holds B as a PENDING contact after the pairing-ack, and must confirm B
 * before the chat opens. A pending contact has no openable detail page, so
 * step 4 below drives that confirm as an INLINE action on the contacts-list
 * row (`contact-pending-confirm-<hex>`) before A can send. The "no second
 * scan" guarantee AC-ADMIT-6
 * anchors on is UNCHANGED and still fully proven here — a confirm tap is not
 * a scan, B is never re-scanned, and B (the scanner) is still admitted
 * immediately, unaffected, since scanning is itself an intentional act.
 * Only the "immediately" qualifier on A's side of "both directions work" is
 * superseded, to "both directions work once A confirms".
 *
 * Requires the strfry relay harness: make e2e-up (or make test-e2e-groups).
 * Run: E2E_GROUPS=1 node scripts/run-e2e.mjs tests/e2e/dm-pairing-single-scan-mutual.spec.ts
