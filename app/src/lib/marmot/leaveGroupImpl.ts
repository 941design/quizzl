 *    fetches itself (getGroupMembers(mlsGroup.state), never a caller-passed
 *    value — AC-STRUCT-3). When the caller is the group's last member, neither
 *    the kind-13 leave-intent nor the kind-9 announcement is sent. Otherwise
 *    both fire, unchanged from prior behavior.
 *  - Fail-closed in the OPPOSITE direction from the eligibility/modal decision:
 *    when mlsGroup can't be read, members is undefined, isLastMember is false,
 *    and the send branch is taken (send-anyway) — a redundant send into an
 *    already-empty group is the safe failure mode here, whereas silently
 *    skipping a real departure is not.
 *  - Purge hygiene (AC-PURGE-1/2): the two-clear leak fix
 *    (clearPendingJoinRequestsForGroup, clearInviteLinksForGroup) runs
 *    unconditionally, after the send block, on BOTH the abandon and the
 *    normal-leave path. `clearInviteExpiries` (epic: invite-link-lifecycle,
 *    S4) runs in the same unconditional block, immediately after
 *    clearInviteLinksForGroup (AC-DEEPLINK-4). `clearPendingDirectInvitesForGroup`
 *    (epic: invite-rescind-and-member-removal, S3, AC-MARKER-9) runs in the
 *    same unconditional block, scoped to exactly the group being left.
 *  - Never throws to the caller: a failed kind-13 send is caught and logged;
 *    the purge always proceeds. Returns `true` unconditionally, matching the
 *    pre-extraction signature.
 *  - Zero imports from app/src/context/ (AC-BOUND-1).
