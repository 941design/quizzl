/**
 * walledGarden.ts — Whitelist computation for the DM walled-garden feature.

 * Single export: `isAllowedDmSender`. Pure function over the current MLS group
 * snapshot and the ever-known peers set — no IDB, no NDK, no React, no side effects.
 *
 * Whitelist definition (S1 — ever-known peers): a peer pubkey is allowed if it
 * appears in `group.memberPubkeys` of at least one currently joined MLS group OR
 * in the `knownPeers` set (AC-SEC-12), excluding the user's own pubkey (DD-10,
 * AC-SEC-1).
 *
 * Comparisons are case-insensitive (AC-SEC-2) because Nostr pubkeys arrive in
 * various capitalisations from different relay and client implementations.
 *
 * AC-SEC-13: `isAllowedDmSender` is and must remain synchronous and free of any
 * IDB, NDK, React, or localStorage access inside its body.

/**
 * Determines whether `peerHex` is a permitted DM sender for the local user.

 * @param peerHex      - Hex pubkey of the candidate sender. May be any case.
 * @param groups       - Snapshot of the user's currently joined MLS groups.
 * @param knownPeers   - Set of ever-known peer pubkeys (lowercase hex).
 * @param ownPubkeyHex - The local user's hex pubkey (any case, or null/undefined).
 *
 * @returns `true` if and only if:
 *   - `peerHex` is non-empty, AND
 *   - `peerHex` (case-insensitive) does NOT equal `ownPubkeyHex`, AND
 *   - `groups` is non-empty OR `knownPeers` is non-empty, AND

 *
 * Returns `false` for any other case, including empty `peerHex`, self-addressing,
 * or a peer absent from both groups and knownPeers.
 *
 * AC-SEC-13: this function reads exclusively from its four declared parameters.
 * No IDB, NDK, React, or localStorage access occurs inside this body.
