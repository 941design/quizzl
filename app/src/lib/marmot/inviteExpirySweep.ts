/**
 * Client-side invite-link expiry sweep (epic: invite-link-lifecycle, S4).
 *
 * Scans every locally-stored invite link — all groups, with no "created by
 * this user" filter (architecture.md's Implementation Constraints: invite
 * link state is already confined to the creating device by construction,
 * so there is nothing to filter by). For each link that is expired
 * (`isExpired(link, now)`) and not yet `expiryNotified`, it:
 *
 *   1. Persists `expiryNotified: true` via `markInviteLinkExpiryNotified`
 *      (the IDB write) — BEFORE
 *   2. Bumping the in-memory `inviteExpiries` badge slice via
 *      `incrementInviteExpiry(link.groupId)`.
 *
 * That ordering is load-bearing (AC-INV-4, Design Decision 8): an
 * interruption between the two steps leaves the link "stamped but not
 * shown", which the next `initInviteExpiries()` call recovers correctly by
 * re-deriving the count straight from the (now-persisted) flags — never
 * "shown twice" and never silently lost.
 *
 * Concurrent invocations — React StrictMode's mount/unmount/remount double
 * effect firing this sweep on load, two `NotificationBell` instances
 * mounted at once for the desktop/mobile breakpoints (Layout.tsx renders
 * both; only one is visible per viewport, but both are mounted), each on
 * their own 60s interval, or a plain overlapping interval tick — are
 * deduplicated onto a single in-flight promise, mirroring
 * `migrateInviteLinks`'s latch in `inviteLinkStorage.ts`. A second call
 * that arrives while a sweep pass is running returns the SAME promise
 * rather than re-scanning the store, so a link can never be notified twice
 * from two overlapping passes (AC-INV-1, AC-NOTIFY-2). Once a pass
 * completes and its stamps are persisted, a later, non-overlapping call
 * naturally skips already-`expiryNotified` links via the guard below — the
 * latch only needs to cover genuine overlap, not every later tick.
 *
 * Migration-suppressed links (`expiryNotified` already `true` — either from
 * a genuine prior sweep pass, or from `migrateInviteLinks`'s AC-MIGRATE-3/5
 * back-stamp for links that were already expired, or muted, before this
 * feature existed) are simply skipped by the `!link.expiryNotified` guard
 * below. This module never re-derives or overrides that decision —
 * AC-INV-3's suppression guarantee belongs to `migrateInviteLinks` itself;
 * this module's only obligation is to never clobber it.

 * One full expiry-notification cycle: migrate legacy records, then — ONLY if

 * badge from persisted flags.
 *
 * Migration MUST precede the sweep on EVERY cycle, not just the first:
 *  - If migration REJECTS, the sweep is skipped this cycle. An un-migrated
 *    legacy expired record has no `expiryNotified` flag, so sweeping it would
 *    fire a retroactive-expiry notification — exactly the flood
 *    `migrateInviteLinks` suppresses (AC-INV-3, Design Decision 3). The next
 *    cycle retries migration.
 *  - Running migration before EACH interval tick (not only on mount) covers
 *    legacy records introduced after startup — e.g. an older backup restored
 *    while the app is open — so an interval sweep never treats a freshly
 *    restored legacy expired link as newly expired.
 * `migrateInviteLinks` is idempotent and cheap (in-flight-latched, fills only
 * missing fields), so re-running it every tick is safe.
 *
 * `derive` always runs (even when migration failed): re-deriving from the
 * already-persisted flags never floods, because an un-migrated legacy link has
 * no `expiryNotified` and is excluded by the derive predicate.
