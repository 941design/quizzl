# Notifications & unread

*What the app draws your attention to — new messages, join requests, expiring invite
links — and, just as importantly, what it deliberately stays quiet about. Plus how unread
counts are kept honest across reloads.*

---

## 1. What this covers

The app keeps an **in-app notification indicator** and **unread counts** so you can see, at
a glance, where there is something new. All of it is **derived locally** from activity your
device has already received over the encrypted channels — nothing about your notifications
or read state is ever published to anyone.

Notifications reuse the **same gates as messaging** (the walled garden, blocking, pending
contacts): the indicator can never surface something the app would not have let you receive
or see in the first place. That consistency is the point of the two rules below.

---

## 2. The two rules

Everything about the indicator follows from two invariants:

- **Activity you are not looking at raises a notification.** A new message, request, or
  expiry for something you do not currently have open increments the relevant unread count.
- **Activity in what you *are* looking at does not.** A change to the conversation you
  currently have open does **not** raise a notification — the open view simply updates in
  place, and being in it marks it read.

In short: the indicator is for things happening *away from your attention*, never a nag
about the thing already in front of you.

---

## 3. What raises a notification

There are four kinds of new activity the indicator reflects:

- **A new group message** — raises the unread count for that group, unless you currently have
  that group open. Your own messages never count.
- **A new direct message** — raises the unread count for that conversation, unless you have it
  open. This is subject to the full set of gates in §4 (a stranger's, a blocked person's, or
  a still-pending contact's message does not raise anything). Only actual chat messages count
  — a reaction or other background signal does not.
- **A group join request** — raises a count for the admin who received it, unless they have
  that group open. A duplicate of a request already pending does not count again.
- **One of your invite links expiring** — raises a count for the group the link belonged to,
  once per link, noticed by a periodic check.

The indicator combines all four into a single overall signal, and reads as "nothing new"
when all are clear.

## 4. What never raises a notification

The following are deliberately silent — several of them the same rules that govern messaging
itself:

- **Your own messages** — you are never notified about what you sent.
- **The conversation you have open** — an open group or DM updates in place and is marked
  read, never notified (rule two, §2).
- **A message from a stranger** — someone outside the walled garden (neither a current
  group co-member nor an ever-known peer) is dropped before it is stored or counted; they
  cannot get your attention at all. (See the Contacts document for the reachability model.)
- **A message from a blocked person** — vetoed at the same gate; blocking silences them
  everywhere, including the indicator.
- **A message from a still-pending contact** — a contact you have not yet confirmed is held
  quietly: their messages are received but raise nothing while they are pending. Nothing is
  lost — the messages that arrived while they waited appear when you next open the
  conversation — but they arrive **already read**, so the indicator never reflects them.
- **A join request that gets dropped** — a request through a muted or expired invite link,
  from someone already a member, or one that fails its authenticity check is silently
  discarded and never raises anything (see the Groups document).
- **Background signals and non-message activity** — profile updates, pairing
  acknowledgements, and — *inside a group* — reactions, message edits and deletes, new polls,
  and members joining or leaving do **not** raise the indicator. Only an actual new chat
  message in an unopened group raises its count. (So a new poll posted to a group you do not
  have open will not, by itself, get your attention — worth knowing.)

These gates are evaluated on **every** incoming message against the *current* state, so a
person you block mid-conversation stops raising notifications from their very next message.

---

## 5. Unread counts, kept honest

Unread counts are designed so they neither miss activity nor invent it:

- **Marking a conversation read** records how far you have read (a per-conversation "last
  read" point), so older messages are never re-counted and re-opening a conversation you have
  caught up on shows nothing new.
- **Counts are reconstructed on startup** from your stored history, so a reload does not lose
  or double-count unread activity — and this reconstruction never clobbers a live message
  that arrives while it is running, nor lets a count regress below what is genuinely unread.
  (One narrow exception: a direct message that raised a count for a conversation you never
  opened leaves no stored copy, so after a reload that particular unread is recovered only if
  the network re-delivers the message, not from local history.)
- **Some counts also go down as you act on the items** — approving or declining a group join
  request lowers that group's pending-request count, one at a time.
- **Some counts are cleared entirely** (rather than marked read) when the underlying
  relationship ends: blocking a contact removes their unread count along with the wiped
  conversation, and a departed stranger being cleaned up removes theirs.

The net effect: the indicator reflects genuinely-unseen activity, and stays stable across
closing and reopening the app.

---

## 6. Edge cases and how they resolve

**You block someone mid-conversation.** Their **next** message — and every one after —
raises nothing; the gate is re-checked per message against the live block state.

**A contact is both pending and blocked.** Blocked wins — silent either way.

**A pending contact you then confirm.** Confirming does not itself resurface a count for what
arrived while they were pending; instead, the held messages become visible — and are marked
read — the next time you open the conversation. Nothing is lost; it simply appears as
already-read history rather than as a fresh notification.

**A message arrives for a conversation you have open.** No notification; the view updates and
the conversation stays marked read (rule two).

**A stranger becomes unreachable and is cleaned up.** Their unread count is removed along with
their conversation. (A *blocked* peer's count is instead removed at the moment you block them
— a different trigger, §5.)

**An invite link expires.** Noticed within a short interval by a periodic check and counted
once; it is not re-counted on later checks, and the count survives a reload because it is
derived from stored state.

**A link expires while you have its group open.** It is consumed silently at that moment —
and because each link is only ever counted once, it will not resurface as a notification
later either.

**An expiry counted for a group you have since left.** It still contributes to the indicator,
but it remains clearable (shown as an unknown group) and clears on interaction — every counted
expiry stays dismissible.

**A reload while counts are being rebuilt.** The rebuild re-reads to catch any message that
arrived mid-rebuild, and never lowers a count below what is actually unread.

## 7. Deliberately out of scope

- **Publishing anything about your notifications or read state** — all of it is local; nothing
  is sent to anyone.
- **Notifying for activity you could not receive anyway** — strangers and blocked peers are
  silenced by the same gates that stop their messages.
- **Per-message or per-conversation muting** — beyond blocking a contact and the
  open-conversation suppression, there is no selective mute.
- **System/OS-level push notifications** — this document describes the in-app indicator and
  unread counts; delivery of alerts outside the app is not part of this behaviour.

- Implementation under `app/src/lib/unreadStore.ts` (the four counter slices, last-read
  timestamps, startup reconstruction, purge), `app/src/lib/directMessageNotifications.ts` and
