 * whether the write actually landed instead of returning `void`.
 *
 * This is the neutralized cache-write primitive spec.md §3.5 requires for
 * the profile-announce receive path (epic: direct-contact-profile-exchange,
 * story 04, AC-PROF-4): `writeContactEntry`'s unconditional `rememberContact`
 * call silently creates a new `lp_contacts_v1` entry for ANY sender, which is
 * exactly the contact-injection vector the announce-accept gate must close.
 * This function never creates a contact — a caller that wants "accept only
 * from an already-existing contact" enforces that gate itself (as
 * `dmProfile/receive.ts` does) before ever calling this.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT change `writeContactEntry` itself, nor any of its
 * existing callers (group profile sync via `MarmotContext.tsx`, card import
 * via `contactCardImport.ts`) — this is a new, additive function living
 * alongside it. Shared with story 07's `pairingAck.ts` §10.1 fix, which
 * reuses this primitive rather than re-implementing LWW or contact-injection
 * neutralization.
 *
 * Defensively lowercases `pubkeyHex` before both the read and the write
 * (architecture.md: "pubkey map-keys are case-folded defensively at every
 * read/write site") rather than relying on the caller to have already
 * folded it.
 *
 * Idempotent (AC-PROF-10): calling this twice with the identical `contact`
 * payload leaves the cache in the same state as calling it once — the
 * second call's `existing.updatedAt` equals `contact.updatedAt`, which is
 * not `<` it, so `lwwWon` is `false` and no write occurs.
 *
 * Silently reports an all-`false` result (never throws) when localStorage
 * is unavailable or a write attempt throws (e.g. quota exceeded) — matching
 * `writeContactEntry`'s existing silent-failure posture. A thrown write
 * attempt means the entry was NOT durably persisted, so `landed`/`lwwWon`
 * must not claim it was.
