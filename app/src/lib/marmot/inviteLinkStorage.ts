 * expiry sweep) was between its `get` and `set` when a clear ran, the clear
 * would land first and the RMW's `set` would land AFTER it — resurrecting a
 * stale record onto what was supposed to become a fresh/empty store (e.g. on
 * account reset/wipe).
 *
 * `clearInFlight` is the barrier: non-null exactly while a clear is
 * in-progress (draining prior locks, then physically clearing). Every RMW
 * funnels through `withNonceLock`, so gating happens in exactly one place.
 *
 * Why there is no ordering hole: JS is single-threaded and neither
 * `withNonceLock`'s prelude (capturing `barrier`/`prior`, computing `run`,
 * registering it in `nonceLocks`) nor `clearAllInviteLinks`'s prelude
 * (snapshotting `drain`, assigning `clearInFlight`) contains an `await` —
 * each runs to completion as one atomic synchronous block with no
 * interleaving possible. That leaves exactly two cases for any given
 * `withNonceLock` call relative to a `clearAllInviteLinks` call:
 *
 *  1. It starts (registers into `nonceLocks`) BEFORE `clearAllInviteLinks`
 *     takes its `drain` snapshot: the drain snapshot captures this call's
 *     settled-wrapper promise, so the clear's `drain` wait — and therefore
 *     the actual `clear()` — cannot proceed until this call's `fn` (its full
 *     get+set) has completed. Its `set` is therefore always ordered BEFORE
 *     the clear.
 *  2. It starts AFTER `clearAllInviteLinks` has assigned `clearInFlight`:
 *     `barrier = clearInFlight` captures the non-null barrier synchronously
 *     at call time, so `gated` (and therefore `fn`, and therefore this
 *     call's own `get`) cannot run until the barrier — drain-then-clear —
 *     has fully resolved. Its `get` therefore always observes the
 *     post-clear (empty) state, and any existing-record branch naturally
 *     no-ops via the same "nonce does not resolve" guard every mutator
 *     already has.
 *
 * There is no third case (e.g. "registered before the drain snapshot but
 * whose `set` lands after the clear") because case 1 above guarantees the
 * clear cannot even begin running until every lock present at drain time —
 * including this one — has fully settled.
