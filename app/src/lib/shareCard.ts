/**
 * shareCard.ts — pure card-production + cache-invalidation helpers for the
 * "Share contact card" surface (epic: contact-card-exchange, story S6;
 * extended by epic: contact-pairing-code, story S2, RD-2).
 *
 * This is deliberately a thin, React-free layer sitting between the codec
 * seam (`@/src/lib/contactCard`) and its callers (profile.tsx). It exists so:
 *
 *   1. The signed-card cache's staleness rule (rebuild iff the nickname, the
 *      active signer mode, the active identity's pubkey, or — since S2 — the
 *      active pairing nonce changed since the last build — VQ-S6-001,
 *      VQ-S6-006, AC-NONCE-7) is a plain, jsdom-free-testable pure function
 *      instead of logic buried in a React effect/callback. The pubkeyHex
 *      check guards a mid-session identity restore that lands on an
 *      unchanged (nickname, signerMode) pair — see `ShareCardCacheKey`.
 *   2. The exact production path callers use can be exercised by
 *      adapter-mode unit tests (local-key / NIP-07-stub / NIP-46-stub)
 *      without importing any page or React context.
 *
 * `getOwnShareCard` is the orchestration entry point profile.tsx calls. It
 * owns the actual signer selection
 * (`activeEventSignerOverride.current ?? createPrivateKeySigner(privateKeyHex)`,
 * the existing precedent — see IncomingCallWatcher.tsx) and passes it in via
 * `getSignEvent`, so this module never sees a private key and never imports
 * `signerAdapter` itself. `NpubQrModal.tsx` never imports this module either —
 * it only ever receives the resulting `shareUrl` string as a prop.
 *
 * Since story S2, `getOwnShareCard` always produces a v2 pairing card
 * (`encodeCardV2`, via `buildOwnShareCardV2`) — every shared card carries an
 * issuer-minted nonce+expiry so a scanner can reciprocate (S3/S4). The
 * active nonce is resolved from `@/src/lib/pairing/nonceStore` (RD-2's
 * mint-or-reuse lifecycle); architecture.md's module map explicitly
 * consolidates "issuer nonce store" and "share lifecycle" as one cohesive
 * concern for this story, so this file importing its sibling nonce module is
 * expected, not a boundary violation. `buildOwnShareCard` (the v1 identity-only
 * builder) currently has NO production caller — the Share surface emits v2
 * pairing cards exclusively (`getOwnShareCard` → `buildOwnShareCardV2`) — and is
 * retained only as preexisting exported API (and for its own unit coverage); see
 * its function-level doc for the full rationale.
