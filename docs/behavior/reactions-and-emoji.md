# Reactions & emoji

*Reacting to a message with an emoji — in group chats and 1:1 direct messages — how
reactions aggregate, who a reaction is trustworthy as coming from, and when
they are cleared.*

---

## 1. The emoji set

The app offers a **fixed, curated set** of common emoji. They are used in two places:

- **Composing a message** — you can insert an emoji into the text you are writing.
- **Reacting to a message** — you can attach an emoji to someone else's (or your own)
  message without sending a reply.

The set is deliberately curated and finite; there is no support for arbitrary or custom
(image) emoji.

## 2. Reacting to a message

You can react to any message — in a **group chat** or a **1:1 direct message** — with an
emoji. Reactions are **additive per person**: you may attach **several different** emoji to
the same message, and each is tracked separately.

A reaction you add appears **immediately**, before it has finished being sent. If sending
fails (every relay rejects a direct-message reaction, or the group send fails), the reaction
is **rolled back** and you are told it did not go through; it is **not** retried
automatically, so a failed *added* reaction simply disappears rather than lingering in a
half-sent state.

A reaction is delivered over the **same private channel as the conversation it belongs
to** — inside the encrypted group for a group message, and as sealed 1:1 mail for a direct
message (§6). It carries which message it reacts to, so it attaches to the right message on
every participant's device.

---

## 3. Removing a reaction

Reacting a second time with the **same** emoji **removes** it — reactions toggle. Removing
one of your reactions affects only **your** reaction with that emoji; everyone else's
reactions, and your *other* emoji on the same message, are untouched. Removal shows
immediately; if it fails to send it is rolled back by **restoring** the reaction, so it
reappears rather than silently vanishing.

A removal is **permanent for that emoji on that message**. Conflicts are resolved by letting
a removal always win over an add for the same message-and-emoji — so an out-of-order delivery
can never resurrect a reaction you took back. That rule has a sharp consequence: once you
remove an emoji from a message, **re-adding the same emoji does not take** — it shows on your
own device but reaches no one else. Reacting with a *different* emoji is unaffected.

---

## 4. How reactions appear

Reactions are shown **per message**, grouped **by emoji**: each distinct emoji on a message
carries a **count** of how many people used it and the list of **who** reacted (in the
order they reacted). Your own reactions are distinguished from other people's. A reaction only ever attaches to the specific message
it targets.

---

## 5. Who a reaction is attributed to — and how trustworthy that is

A reaction records **who** reacted, but how strongly that attribution can be trusted differs
by channel — and the difference is worth stating honestly:

- **In a 1:1 direct message**, a reaction's author is **cryptographically authenticated**:
  the sealed envelope proves who sent it, so a DM reaction cannot be forged to look like it
  came from someone else.
- **In a group**, a reaction's author is **member-attested only** — the reacting identity is
  self-reported and is *not* cryptographically bound to the sender. A group member could, in
  principle, forge a reaction attributed to another member. This is the **same trust model
  the app already applies to group chat messages**: group membership is cryptographically
  enforced (a non-member cannot inject anything), but identity *within* the member set is
  taken at its word. The limitation comes from the underlying group-messaging library, and
  is documented in **ADR-006**.

---

## 6. Privacy

Reactions are never posted publicly. A group reaction travels inside the group's encrypted
channel; a DM reaction is sealed and single-addressed, with the sender hidden from relays.
No reaction is ever readable on a public relay — consistent with the app's rule that who is
talking to whom is not exposed.

---

## 7. When reactions are cleared

Reactions are stored locally, per conversation, and are cleared together with the
conversation they belong to:

- **Blocking a contact** deletes the **whole** reaction store for that 1:1 conversation —
  both your reactions and theirs — along with the rest of the wiped conversation.
- **The stranger cleanup after a membership change** deletes the reaction stores of people
  who are no longer reachable at all (true strangers; ex-group-mates normally stay reachable
  and are kept — see the Contacts document). This cleanup touches **only 1:1** reactions — a
  departed member's reactions *inside a group you remain in* are kept.
- **Resetting or switching the account** clears all stored reactions.

---

## 8. Edge cases and how they resolve

**A reaction arrives for a message you don't have.** Silently discarded — the app does not
fetch the unknown message, and no stray reaction is stored.

**The same reaction is delivered more than once** (e.g. a relay re-broadcasts it). Ignored
as a duplicate; it is counted only once.

**A malformed reaction.** Ignored rather than applied.

**Removing a reaction when you have several emoji on one message.** The removal names which
emoji it undoes, so only that one is removed; the others stay. A removal that does *not* name
an emoji is applied only when you have exactly one reaction on that message; if it is
ambiguous (none, or more than one), it is discarded rather than guessed.

**Re-adding an emoji you previously removed from a message.** Does not take (§3) — the
removal wins permanently; only a different emoji works.

**A member reacts and then leaves the group.** Their existing reactions stay stored and
visible to the members who remain — leaving does not retract them.

**A reaction to a message after you have left the group.** You can neither send nor receive
further reactions there — leaving cuts off the channel, so no later reaction reaches you.

**Your own reactions after a reload.** Persist — they are stored locally, so reopening a
conversation shows them again.

## 9. Deliberately out of scope

- **Custom or arbitrary emoji** (image emoji / the wider emoji universe) — the set is a
  fixed curated list.
- **Cryptographically authenticated group-reaction authorship** — not possible today; group
  reactions are member-attested (§5), pending an upstream library capability (ADR-006).
- **Reacting across the walled garden** — you can only react within conversations you are
  part of; a reaction from someone you cannot receive messages from is dropped.

## Sources

Reconciled across product specifications, acceptance criteria, architecture decisions, the
shipped implementation, and the automated test suite:

- `specs/emoji-feature-portable-spec.md` and `specs/epic-emoji-feature/` — the emoji set,
  the picker, adding/removing reactions, multi-emoji policy, and optimistic-send-with-
  rollback.
- `docs/adr/ADR-006` (group-member-attested authorization for MLS application messages) —
  the reaction trust model: DMs sealed-authenticated, group reactions self-attested.
- Implementation under `app/src/lib/reactions/` (rumor building, aggregation, storage,
  purge) and the reaction UI in the group and contact chat components.
- The `groups-reactions` and `groups-dm-reactions` end-to-end specs and the unit tests for
  reaction aggregation, toggling, and purge — including the assertion that no plaintext
  reaction is published to a public relay.
