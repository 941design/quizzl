/**
 * Confirms a pending contact and reconciles the notification bell for any
 * messages held while pending — epic: pending-contact-confirmation, story S2
 * (AC-CONFIRM-1 via S1's `confirmContact`, AC-OBS-2 via S1's
 * `reconcileConfirmedContactDirectMessageCount`). Exported separately from
 * the component so the confirm+reconcile orchestration is a plain async
 * function, not tangled with component state — mirrors
 * `BlockContactButton.tsx`'s `performBlockContact`/`performUnblockContact`
 * orchestration-vs-UI split (though those live in a dedicated lib module;
 * this epic's S2 scope does not include a new `app/src/lib/*.ts` file, so
 * the split stays local to this component file).
 *
 * `confirmContact` clears `pendingConfirmationSince` first (S1's own
 * no-op/idempotency guards apply), then
 * `reconcileConfirmedContactDirectMessageCount` recomputes the peer's unread
 * count from persisted chat history — sourced from storage, never
 * re-derived from live relay events (spec.md Design Decision 8). Like
 * `initDirectMessageCounts` (the batch/startup function), it reads via a raw
 * idb-keyval lookup rather than `chatPersistence.ts#loadMessages` — a
 * reconciliation-only caller must never be the one to trigger (or discard
 * the `refetchIds` from) `loadMessages`' one-time-per-thread self-heal pass.
 * An earlier version of this call routed through `loadMessages` on the
 * theory that doing so was safe here because the user is about to view this
 * exact conversation anyway; that was wrong — this function runs on EVERY
 * confirm, so it could easily be the FIRST caller to touch `loadMessages`
 * for a thread, permanently consuming the repair signal before
 * `ContactChat`'s own mount-time call ever saw it. See
 * `reconcileConfirmedContactDirectMessageCount`'s doc comment in
 * unreadStore.ts for the full history.
 *
 * AC-OBS-2 was amended 2026-07-15 (spec.md `## Amendments`,
 * acceptance-criteria.md AC-OBS-2): for a contact whose conversation was
 * never opened while pending, this app has nothing persisted for
 * `reconcileConfirmedContactDirectMessageCount` to read yet — this repo's DM
 * pipeline only writes a contact's message content once their `ContactChat`
 * has mounted at least once (a pre-existing, out-of-epic-scope property) —
 * so this call resolves to a no-op here in the common case. The bell still
 * ends up correct: AC-OBS-1 already guarantees it was never incorrectly
 * bumped for messages received while pending, and the next time the user
 * opens the conversation, `ContactChat` loads the (now-fetchable) history
 * and marks it read via its own `markDirectMessagesRead` mount effect. This
 * call remains useful for any messages that happen to already be persisted
 * (e.g. a conversation opened before the contact went pending) and for the
 * `reconcileInit` live-increment race protection it gets "for free".

           * Clicking Reject opens the same block confirm modal, which still
           * spells out the real consequences (history wipe, permanent
           * exclusion) before anything is actioned — the heavy semantics stay
           * honest. No local `onChanged` bump is needed: blocking calls
           * `notifyBlockedPeersChanged`, which bumps `blockedPeersRevision`
           * (`useMarmot`) that `ContactDetailView`'s own `contact` derivation
           * already depends on — the very next render swaps this whole
           * component out for the Blocked banner (DD-9's "blocked wins over
           * pending"), with no action needed here.
