/**
 * ProfileHealWatcher.tsx — always-mounted integration component driving the
 * direct-contact profile-heal loop (epic: direct-contact-profile-exchange,
 * story 05; AC-WATCH-1, AC-WATCH-2).
 *
 * 5th sibling of `DirectMessageNotificationsWatcher` / `PendingPairingIntentWatcher`
 * / `IncomingCallWatcher` in `Layout.tsx`. Owns exactly two responsibilities,
 * neither involving any backoff math or disclosure-gate logic of its own
 * (architecture.md: "Integration wiring only" — all math lives in
 * `dmProfile/scheduler.ts` (story 02), all outbound construction in
 * `dmProfile/send.ts` (story 03), both dispatch arms in `dmProfile/receive.ts`
 * (story 04)):
 *
 *   1. **Due-sweep lifecycle (AC-WATCH-1).** On mount, on window `'online'`,
 *      and on a `DUE_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MS` interval: recompute which contacts
 *      need a brand-new schedule (via `computeContactsNeedingNewSchedule` —
 *      the ONLY sanctioned source, per the S02 ownership-ledger contract, so
 *      a terminal/`given-up`/`answered-incomplete` contact is never
 *      resurrected) and which existing schedules are due (`computeDue`), then
 *      fires each due request (`send.ts#sendProfileRequest`) and advances +
 *      persists its schedule (`scheduler.ts#advance` + `saveSchedule`). When
 *      MORE than `BULK_SWEEP_STAGGER_THRESHOLD` contacts are due in one
 *      sweep, the sends are spread across `BULK_SWEEP_STAGGER_WINDOW_MS`
 *      (`planDueSweep`'s `delayMs`) IN ADDITION to each fire's own +/-20%
 *      jitter already baked into `nextAttemptAt` by the scheduler — this is
 *      the dispatch-time stampede guard spec.md §5 requires; the scheduler's
 *      jitter alone only spreads WHEN a schedule next becomes due, not how a
 *      big batch of already-due schedules is drained in one tick.
 *   2. **Dedicated inbound subscription (AC-WATCH-2).** Opens its OWN
 *      `ndk.subscribe({kinds:[GIFT_WRAP_KIND],'#p':[ownPubkeyHex]})` — a
 *      fourth kind-1059 consumer alongside `welcomeSubscription.ts`,
 *      `DirectMessageNotificationsWatcher`, and `IncomingCallWatcher`'s call
 *      signaling sub, per `exploration.json`'s `DISPATCH_SEAM_DECISION`. Every
 *      inbound wrap is strictly unwrapped via
 *      `directMessages.ts#unwrapAndOpen` ONLY — never
 *      `welcomeSubscription.ts#unwrapGiftWrap` — and routed by inner kind
 *      (`decideDispatch`) to `receive.ts`'s `handleProfileRequest` /
 *      `handleProfileAnnounce`. Cannot filter the subscription by author:
 *      gift-wrap outer `pubkey` is an ephemeral per-wrap key (project
 *      learning `kind-445-events-have-ephemeral-authors`), so `'#p'` is the
 *      only filter term, exactly like the three pre-existing consumers.
 *
 * ## D4 reset-on-activity (spec.md §3.2, Resolved Decisions)
 *
 * A `profile-request` receipt from a contact is itself a D4 "this contact is
 * reachable" signal — independent of whether the disclosure gate ends up
 * answering it (that gate governs OUR disclosure, not whether the sender is
 * observably online). This watcher applies `scheduler.ts#applyReachabilitySignal`
 * to that sender's OWN existing schedule (if any — a stranger with no tracked
 * schedule is an inert no-op) before invoking `handleProfileRequest`. A
 * `profile-announce` receipt is EXCLUDED from D4 by construction
 * (`decideDispatch` never sets `applyReachability` for it) — the S02
 * ownership-ledger's `announce-schedule-routing` contract already covers an
 * announce's schedule effect (clear-on-completing / mark-incomplete / none,
 * `receive.ts#decideScheduleAction`) and D4 re-arming an announce would
 * reopen the answer->reset->re-request loop REVIEW G2 closed.
 *
 * **Scope note (documented, not fixed here):** spec.md §3.2's D4 is phrased
 * as "any inbound gift-wrapped event…other than a profile-announce receipt" —
 * broader than just this watcher's own two kinds. This component only owns
 * its OWN dedicated subscription; a chat DM, reaction, or call-signaling
 * event observed by one of the OTHER three kind-1059 consumers is NOT wired
 * as a D4 signal here (doing so would require reaching into those
 * subscriptions, explicitly out of this story's AC-WATCH-2 isolation
 * requirement — "no changes to their subscription filters"). Broader D4
 * wiring across all inbound channels is a future enhancement, not this
 * story's job.
 *
 * ## Archive-suppression (AC-PROF-4b's outbound half)
 *
 * `scheduler.ts` is deliberately contact/archive-blind (architecture.json's
 * `dependencies_forbidden` bars it from importing `contacts.ts`), so
 * "the scheduler must send an archived contact no further requests" can only
 * be enforced where both the due-set and archive state are in scope: here.
 * `planDueSweep` filters the due set against the same `contacts` snapshot
 * already read for `computeIncompleteSet`, before staggering — see that
 * function's doc.
