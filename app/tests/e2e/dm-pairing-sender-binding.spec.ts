/**
 * E2E: pairing — sender binding rejects a harvested third-party card
 * (AC-SEC-1, AC-PAIR-6b; security-critical).
 *
 * Epic: contact-pairing-code, story S6. Proves: a pairing-ack gift wrap
 * whose enclosed `card` names a DIFFERENT pubkey than the gift wrap's own
 * authenticated (real, validly-signed) sender admits NOBODY — not the named
 * card's pubkey, and not the authenticated sender's pubkey either.
 *
 * EXCEPTION NOTICE (read before editing): step 4 below uses
 * helpers/forgedPairingAck.ts#sendForgedPairingAck — the ONE place in this
 * story's specs that constructs a signed event outside the app's own UI.
 * This is the narrow, CLAUDE.md-sanctioned exception ("events the app
 * cannot itself produce"): pairingAck.ts#sendPairingAck's real send path
 * ALWAYS encloses the caller's OWN card, so there is no UI action that can
 * make a real user's app send someone else's card — the exact input AC-SEC-1
 * defends against is structurally unreachable through normal use. See that
 * helper's file header for the full justification, including why the gift
 * wrap's AUTHENTICATED sender (the attacker's real key/signature) is never
 * spoofed — only the enclosed card's claimed identity is. Every OTHER action
 * in this spec (A's and B's real cards, B's real legitimate scan in the
 * positive-control step) is driven through the app exactly like every other
 * spec in this story.
 *
 * Requires the strfry relay harness: make e2e-up (or make test-e2e-groups).
 * Run: E2E_GROUPS=1 node scripts/run-e2e.mjs tests/e2e/dm-pairing-sender-binding.spec.ts
