/**
 * Unit tests for the ATTACHMENTS_ENABLED feature toggle (app/src/config/features.ts).
 *
 * Message attachments are being deprecated. The feature code is retained; the
 * toggle removes every entry point that can COMPOSE a new attachment. ChatBox
 * is the single composer behind all three surfaces (contacts/DM, groups, and
 * the developer/feedback channel), and it has three distinct attach entry
 * points — the attach button, drag/drop, and clipboard paste.
 *
 * Those three drifting apart is this feature's known failure mode: the
 * block-contact epic shipped a gate that covered the button but not paste/drop
 * (see contactChat-block-gating.test.ts and feedback-block-gating.test.ts's own
 * doc comments). This file exists to make a partial gate fail loudly, by
 * proving all three consult ONE derived flag rather than re-deriving their own.
 *
 * Convention (no jsdom/@testing-library in this repo — see
 * contactChat-block-gating.test.ts): ChatBox.tsx is a Chakra/React component
 * that cannot be mounted here, so its wiring is proved by a source assertion,
 * and the gate expression itself is proved behaviorally against the real
 * exported constant.
