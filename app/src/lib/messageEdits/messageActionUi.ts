/**
 * Pure UI helper functions for the message edit/delete surface (S6,
 * epic-feature-request-message-edit-and-delete).
 *
 * Mirrors `app/src/lib/reactions/reactionUiHelpers.ts`'s precedent: these
 * helpers are extracted from `ChatBox.tsx` so the action-menu gating,
 * edit-submit validation, delete-confirmation transition, and list-preview
 * computation can be unit tested without mounting React (this project has
 * no @testing-library/react / jsdom dependency — see
 * `themes/contrast.hexParsing.test.ts:3-6`).
 *
 * Exported from lib/ so components/chat/ and components/groups/ (GroupCard)
 * can both import without violating the downward-import rule (lib/ ← components/
 * is forbidden; components/ → lib/ is allowed).
 *
 * `computeThreadPreviewMessage` intentionally imports `filterVisibleMessages`
 * from `chatPersistence.ts` — the same pure tombstone-read-filter S1 defined
 * for every render path (`chatPersistence.ts:524`'s doc comment names "list
 * preview" explicitly as a consumer). This is a read-only filter import, not
 * a write/reconciliation primitive — it does not pull in `messageEdits/api.ts`
 * or `messageEdits/rumor.ts`.

 *
 * `allowMessageActions` (default true) is the surface-level gate: the
