/**
 * deleteEditHandler.ts
 *
 * RumorHandler for kind-5 delete/edit signal rumors (group transport) — Seam
 * S5 consumer of S3's reconciliation core (applyDeleteEditSignal) and S2's
 * wire-builder constant (DELETE_EDIT_RUMOR_KIND).
 *
 * Receives all side-effect dependencies via the deps bag injected at
 * buildDispatcher(deps) time — no React context imports (architecture.md
 * boundary rule, ownership-ledger.json concept id 'handler-no-context-import').
 *
 * Boundary rules (architecture.md):
 *   - Zero imports from app/src/context/
 *   - All IDB and state-setter deps received via injection
 *
 * ─── Deliberately NO pre-gate (unlike reactionHandler.ts:36-41) ────────────
 *
 * reactionHandler.ts silently discards a kind-7 reaction whose target message
 * is not yet known locally (a known-target gate BEFORE calling into the
 * reactions core). This handler does the OPPOSITE for kind-5: every inbound
 * rumor is routed to `applyDeleteEditSignal` UNCONDITIONALLY, with no
 * known-target check here at all. S3's `applyDeleteEditSignal` already
 * implements retain-and-apply for an unknown target (AC-ORDER-1: it buffers
 * the signal in its own pending store and applies it once the target
 * arrives) — architecture.md is explicit that this retain logic belongs
 * inside the shared reconciliation module, not reimplemented per-caller, so
 * adding a gate here would silently discard a signal S3 was built to retain.
 *
 * ─── The forwarded pubkey is the INNER rumor pubkey (NOT the kind-445 author) ─
 * ─── but it is group-member-attested, NOT MLS-identity-bound (see below) ──────
 *
 * `rumor.pubkey` (the value this handler forwards to `applyDeleteEditSignal`)
 * is the INNER application-rumor pubkey — never the kind-445 wrapper's
 * ephemeral author (learning `kind-445-events-have-ephemeral-authors`).
 * `applicationRumorDispatcher.ts`'s listener calls `deserializeApplicationData`
 * on the MLS-decrypted application-message bytes and hands EVERY registered
 * handler that decoded rumor object directly — the kind-445 wrapper event
 * (with its ephemeral author) is never exposed past that point. `chatHandler.ts`
 * and `reactionHandler.ts` already rely on this identically.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — trust model (verified against ts-mls / marmot-ts 0.5.1 source):
 * this inner `pubkey` is **NOT** cryptographically bound to the MLS sender.
 * ts-mls returns only the decrypted `{message: Uint8Array}` for an application
 * message and DROPS the authenticated sender leaf credential (proposals keep it;
 * `unprotectPrivateMessage` is not exported), so `deserializeApplicationData`
 * validates field *presence* only and never checks `pubkey` against the sending
 * member's identity. MLS still guarantees the sender is a *current group member*
 * (non-members cannot forge), so AC-AUTH-2's group clause here is
 * **best-effort / group-member-attested**: it stops outsiders and honest
 * mismatches, but a malicious current member can forge `pubkey` to impersonate
 * another member — the same residual Few already carries for kind-9/kind-7.
 * The full MLS-identity binding is tracked upstream:
 * see `BACKLOG.json#marmot-ts-0-5-1-drops` and spec AC-AUTH-2 (2026-07-07 amendment).
 * DMs are unaffected (seal-signature bound). Do NOT overstate this as
 * "MLS-authenticated" — it is not.
